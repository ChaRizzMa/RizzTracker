## Overview

### Description

Inspired by the TikTok videos originating from late 2022, this app strives to quantify rizz into an overall score. This is to incentivize users to become more bold and better! 

The way it works is that your friends on this app report the rizz you showcased at some special event or a night out. Based on those reported stats this app calculates your rizz overall!
