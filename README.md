### App Evaluation

- **Story:** Analyzes users' rizz and makes them become better.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, we will have to anonymize all user data.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.
- **Scope:** Since this app is a lifestyle app that has the potential to track the user's rizz, it has the potential to improve the user's rizz by help the user see the progress they have over time. Additionally this rizz tracking has teh potential to be integrated into existing dating apps such as Tinder or Bumble, maybe it can be integrated into dating coach apps also!
